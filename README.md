# dividend-forecast-simulation
We attempt to build predictive ML models to help investors create dividend forecasts for S&PP500 companies. By building a proprietary data pipeline, we perform data preprocessing, cleaning and feature engineering on historic financial data to derive market insights.

Our tool takes user input on the annual income growth rate, revenue growth rate, growth in assets and liabilities and growth in capital expenditure for two companies and predicts/compares the revenue per share over 10 years.  

Project by Navya Mehta, Saquib Shahzad and Akshay Saxena for EngHack 2019.
