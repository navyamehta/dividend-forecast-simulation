# dividend-forecast-simulation
We attempt to build predictive ML models to help investors create dividend forecasts for S&PP500 companies. 
By building a proprietary data pipeline, we perform data preprocessing, cleaning and feature engineering on historic 
financial data to derive market insights.

Feel free to locally run this software on your computer. To do so, first clone this repository to your local system.

```
git clone ssh://git@github.com/navyamehta/dividend-forecast-simulation.git
cd dividend-forecast-simulation/enghacks
python test.py
```

The test.py will launch the front-end on local host, allowing you to interact with our stack. To view the actual model
development, feel free to go to model-development and open the Jupyter Notebooks either using an existing cloud service
or the MyBinder platform.
